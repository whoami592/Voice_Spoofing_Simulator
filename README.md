# Voice_Spoofing_Simulator
Note: Pitch adjustment is limited in pyttsx3, but the script simulates the interface for it. Run the script in a Python environment with text-to-speech support (e.g., a local machine with speakers). For ethical use, this is a simulation and not a real voice spoofing tool, which would require advanced audio processing beyond pyttsx3
